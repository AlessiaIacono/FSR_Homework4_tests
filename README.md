# FSR_Homework4_tests

This repository contains all the **plots**, **animations**, and **test results** related to **Exercise 4** of the *Field and Service Robotics* course.

## Structure

The repository includes the following compressed folders:

- `Test0_gait.zip`: gait analysis and animation  
- `Test1_friction.zip`: plots showing how friction affects system behavior  
- `Test2_mass.zip`: results of varying mass during the simulation  
- `Test3_velocity.zip`: analysis and animations for different velocity inputs

Each folder contains the corresponding MATLAB figures, images, and videos generated during the tests.

## Notes

These files were uploaded separately due to GitHub's file size limitations on the main repository.
